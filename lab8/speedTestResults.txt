 This program inserts random Strings of length L
 Into different types of maps as <String, Integer> pairs.

What would you like L to be?: 10000

Enter # strings to insert into hashmap.ULLMap: hellolly
Please enter a positive integer: 10000
class hashmap.ULLMap: 0.73 sec

Enter # strings to insert into your hashmap.MyHashMap: hellolly
Please enter a positive integer: 10000
class hashmap.MyHashMap: 0.52 sec

Enter # strings to insert into Java's HashMap: hellolly
Please enter a positive integer: 10000
Java's Built-in HashMap: 0.51 sec


 This program inserts lexicographically increasing Stringsinto Maps as <String, Integer> pairs.

Enter # strings to insert into hashmap.ULLMap: 20000
class hashmap.ULLMap: 0.74 sec

Enter # strings to insert into hashmap.MyHashMap: 20000
class hashmap.MyHashMap: 0.02 sec

Enter # strings to insert into Java's HashMap: 20000
Java's Built-in HashMap: 0.01 sec


If we insert elements in random order, then BSTMap/TreeMap will be better.
But if inserting in order, HashMap will be better.
